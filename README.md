### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jonathan and I'm a software engineer who mostly works on web apps. I write mostly typescript, and I'm learning C right now just for fun. I'm very open to collaboration and I love to work on cool projects. If anything on my profile interests you please feel free to reach out to me I'm friendly and love to talk tech :)
